# Configuration template for interface.ethernet.name.smp_affinity
#
# Configure the CPUs that the associated interface will interrupt.
# SMP affinity is configured by a hexidecimal bitmask that specifies the
# CPUs that the system can interrupt.  The SMP affinity bitmask must contain
# at least one bits, and may only contain as many bits as there are CPUs on
# the system.
